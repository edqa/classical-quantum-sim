## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines. Help is currently sought for:

    Implementing more simulated gates (Pauli-X, CNOT, etc.).

    Adding comprehensive unit tests (Issue #Z).

    Exploring multi-qubit representations (Issue #X).

    Improving documentation and examples.

Roadmap / Future Ideas

    Implement core Pauli and CNOT simulated gates.

    Explore phase representation (potentially using reserved bits).

    Develop framework for multi-qubit systems (registers).

    Optimize performance using techniques like NumPy or Numba if beneficial.

    Compare simulation results to actual quantum simulators for simple circuits.

Limitations & Caveats

    Classical Simulation: This does not achieve quantum speedups.

    No Phase Information: Relative phases between basis states are not tracked, limiting the simulation of interference effects crucial to many quantum algorithms.

    Simplified Entanglement: Simulating entanglement requires specific classical mechanisms to link states, which differ fundamentally from true quantum entanglement.
**Key Changes Made:**

1.  **Introduced Dirac Notation:** Used `|0>`, `|1>`, `|ψ>` for states.
2.  **Clarified Amplitude vs. Probability:** Explained that amplitudes `α`, `β` are not stored, only probabilities `P(|0>)`, `P(|1>)`. Explicitly stated `|α|² + |β|² = 1`.
3.  **Formalized Encoding:** Provided the exact formula `P(|1>) = ProbInt / 1023.0`.
4.  **Defined Gate Actions Formally:** Described Hadamard and Pauli-X effects using `P'(...)` notation referring to probabilities after the gate. Mentioned the underlying quantum gate action for context.
5.  **Formalized Measurement:** Referenced the Born rule concept and explicitly described the probabilistic choice based on `P_stored(|1>)`.
6.  **Reinforced Caveats:** Added specific notes about ignoring phase and the nature of simulated entanglement throughout.
7.  **Added Roadmap/Ideas:** Included a section for future directions.
8.   *Updated Example Output:** Corrected the integer value in the H-gate example output to reflect the bit shifting (assuming `PROB_AMP_SHIFT = 6` and `_probability_to_int(0.5) = 512`, the value is `512 << 6 = 32768`.
